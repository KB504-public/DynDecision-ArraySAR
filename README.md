# DynDecision-ArraySAR
Dynamic Decision Array-SAR reformulates 3D radar imaging as a Markov decision process, replacing static reconstruction with a state–sequence–decision framework. Adaptive actions and evaluation-guided feedback enable robust, scenario-adaptive imaging across noise levels, measurement models, and scene distributions.
