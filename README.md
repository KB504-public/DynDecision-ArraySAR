# DynDecision-ArraySAR

![Overview of DynDecision-ArraySAR](framework_overview.jpg)

Dynamic Decision Array-SAR reformulates 3D radar imaging as a Markov decision process, 
replacing static reconstruction with a state‚Äìsequence‚Äìdecision framework. 
Adaptive actions and evaluation-guided feedback enable robust, scenario-adaptive imaging 
across noise levels, measurement models, and scene distributions.

## üìñ Description
This repository contains the **MATLAB implementation** of our paper:  

**Beyond Static Imaging: A Dynamic Decision Paradigm for Robust Array-SAR in Diverse Sensing Scenarios**

Currently, we provide the **StatFilter** implementation, denoting the static matched filtering method.  
This represents the earliest paradigm in array-SAR imaging, where the reconstruction is directly obtained via a fixed analytical operator, without leveraging any prior knowledge of the scene.
