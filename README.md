# DynDecision-ArraySAR

![Overview of DynDecision-ArraySAR](framework_overview.jpg)

In this work, as shown above, we propose a dynamic decision-making framework for array-SAR imaging. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on static structures, fixed parameters, and outcome-level supervision, our method introduces dynamic structures and parameters guided by state-level supervision, enabling adaptive processing across diverse measurement conditions. The imaging process is reformulated from a static pipeline into a Markov decision process, where the decision-making module selects actions according to the current state, the state-transition module updates the state, and the evaluation module provides feedback on both states and actions. Through this perspective of "from states to sequence, and decision making," the framework advances array-SAR imaging from rigid fixed flows toward adaptive and scenario-specific imaging. This shift allows the proposed method to generalize better for large-scale sensing of diverse scenarios.

This repository contains the **MATLAB implementation** of our paper:  

**Beyond Static Imaging: A Dynamic Decision Paradigm for Robust Array-SAR in Diverse Sensing Scenarios**

Currently, we provide the **StatFilter** implementation, denoting the static matched filtering method.  
This represents the earliest paradigm in array-SAR imaging, where the reconstruction is directly obtained via a fixed analytical operator, without leveraging any prior knowledge of the scene.
